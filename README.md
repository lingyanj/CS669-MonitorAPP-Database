Boston University CS669 Monitor APP Database Design

## Monitor APP description:
For the CS669 project, I want to build a database for the "Monitor-Daily Food Record" application I designed. Simply put, the "Monitor" app records the user's daily diet and gives reasonable fitness exercises and diet suggestions. Many people don’t know whether their daily diets are healthy or not, whether their calorie intake exceeds the recommended limit, or what exercises they can do to expend the calories they have consumed. I am also concerned that many people don’t have access to a nutritionist or a doctor, so the diet problem continues to get worse. That’s the reason I'm going to build this app and its database. This app will solve this problem by analyzing the user’s daily calories, vitamins, sugar, and salt content, and water through the information that users input about their diet and weight, as well as other food delivery app/website data, so as to recommend the proper diet and fitness methods.

## Technology method:
Using Oracle SQL to build the database for Monitor APP and using some example data to show how database store and retrieve data.
